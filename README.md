# Deformable DETR Soccer Analysis

## Overview

This project implements and fine-tunes the Deformable DETR (DEtection TRansformer) model to detect and classify soccer game entities - players, referees, and the ball - using bounding boxes. By leveraging the SoccerNet dataset, this implementation demonstrates how advanced object detection transformers can be applied to sports analytics.

## Features

- **Multi-class Detection**: Accurately identifies players, referees, and the ball with distinct bounding boxes
- **Transformer-based Architecture**: Uses Deformable DETR, an improved version of DETR with deformable attention mechanisms
- **PyTorch Implementation**: Built on PyTorch with HuggingFace transformers integration
- **Coordinate Transformation**: Includes utility functions for converting between bbox formats (XYXY â†” CCWH)
- **Performance Metrics**: Calculates mAP (mean Average Precision) to evaluate detection quality

## Dataset

The SoccerNet dataset provides comprehensive annotated soccer match footage, including:
- High-resolution broadcast video frames
- Precise bounding box annotations for players, referees, and the ball
- Diverse game scenarios across multiple camera angles

Our implementation samples frames at regular intervals (every 10th frame) to reduce training on highly correlated images.

## Technical Implementation

1. **Data Pipeline**: Custom `SoccerNetDataset` class handles data loading and preprocessing
2. **Model Architecture**: Deformable DETR with ResNet backbone
3. **Training Process**: Implemented in PyTorch with customized loss functions
4. **Visualization Tools**: Functions to render predictions and ground truth boxes

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies: `pip install lightning timm transformers torchmetrics`
2. Run notebook: `jupyter notebook deformable_detr_soccer_analysis.ipynb`
